            <item>DOEL LED TV still in her movements ; it took her a long time to prepare her tea ; but when ready it was set forth with as much grace as if she had been a veritable guest to her own self . The little square table stood exactly in the centre of the kitchen , and was covered with a starched linen cloth whose border pattern of flowers glistened . Louisa had a damask napkin on her tea-tray , where were arranged a cut-glass tumbler full of teaspoons , a silver cream-pitcher , a china sugar-bowl , and one pink china cup and saucer. Louisa used china every day — something which none of her neighbors did. They whispered about it among themselves . Their daily tables were laid with common crockery , their sets of best china stayed in the parlor closet , and Louisa Ellis was no richer nor better bred than they . Still she would use the china . She had for her supper a glass dish full of sugared currants , a plate of little cakes , and one of light white biscuits. Also a leaf or two of lettuce, which she cut up daintily. Louisa was very fond of lettuce, which she raised to perfection in her little garden. She ate quite heartily , though in a delicate , pecking way ; it seemed almost surprising that any considerable bulk of the food should vanish.</item>

            <item>TSS Steno set 0025 commotion was over Louisa Ellis also. She had been peacefully sewing at her sitting-room window all the afternoon. Now she quilted her needle carefully into her work, which she folded precisely, and laid in a basket with her thimble and thread and scissors. Louisa Ellis could not remember that ever in her life she had mislaid one of these little feminine appurtenances, which had become, from long use and constant association, a very part of her personality.</item>
